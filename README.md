# Front End Developer

I enjoy understanding problems and solving them elegantly and efficiently, especially if the solution helps to make someone's life easier.

# Skills

- **JavaScript**
    
    ES6, Node, and popular libraries/frameworks like React and Vue

- **HTML and CSS**

    Including SASS and CSS Modules
  
- **Teamwork and Collaboration**

    I've worked in a variety of team environments, and have commerical experience using tools such as Git on a range of different platforms in an agile environment.

    I'm also very versatile and can jump in and provide value to a team very quickly.

- **Other Tech**

    Besides JavaScript I also have used Ruby (including Rails) and Python for web development, and I dabble in other languages from time to time.
