Full-stack junior developer and graduate of the highly-selective 12-week [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com) coding bootcamp in London. Coming from a creative but highly technical background in music production, once I discovered coding I couldn't get enough, and pursuing a career in software development seemed to be an obvious choice for me.

Over the past few months I have grown from an enthusiastic coding hobbyist into someone who has come to value well-tested, clean and reusable code that is easy to understand and expand by the next person to work on it after myself.

Currently seeking a position in London where I can take my skills and learning even further, and where I can be proud of the project I am working on.
