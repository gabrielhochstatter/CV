Full-stack junior developer and graduate of the highly-selective 12-week [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy) coding bootcamp in London. Coming from a creative but highly technical background in music production, once I discovered coding I couldn't get enough, and pursuing a career in software development seemed to be an obvious choice for me.

Over the past few months I have grown from an enthusiastic coding hobbyist into someone who has come to value well-tested, clean and reusable code that is easy to understand and expand by the next person to work on it after myself.

Currently seeking a position in London where I can take my skills and learning even further, and where I can be proud of the product I am working on.

## Skills

*Maybe put tech/languages here?*

- **Fast Learner** - Both in my previous career and in my time learning to code over the past few months, I've always had to learn new skills and technologies in short timeframes. *mention something about final project using new tech with no prior experience*.
- **Problem Solver** - Music production, much like software development, involves solving many small problems in a row to achieve a greater goal.
- **Enthusiastic** - Finding my new passion in coding has made me highly motivated, almost every day I find something new that gets me excited about software development.
- **Creative** - In my previous line of work creativity was essential and I have found it very useful in the early days of my new career.
- **Attention to detail** - I am always looking out to make sure that my work is well-crafted, and the small details are a big part of that.
